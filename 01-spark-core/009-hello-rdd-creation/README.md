# Creating JavaRDD instances
> Creating `JavaRDD`s in Java

## Description
RDDs are used to represent collections in Spark. To work with RDDs in Java you have to use the `JavaRDD` class.

The example illustrates how to create a `JavaRDD`:
+ Using `parallelize` method which accepts a list of elements
+ Using `textFile` which loads the context of a text file into a `JavaRDD<String>`


## Concepts
+ Creating `JavaRDD`
+ Using `parallelize` to create a `JavaRDD` from a materialized List
+ Using `textFile` to create a `JavaRDD` from a file
