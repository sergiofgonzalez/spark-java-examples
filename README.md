# Spark Java Examples
> Examples from **Spark in Action** (*Manning*, 2017) and other sources, all of them in Java

This project bundles *Apache Spark* using Java language instead of Scala.

The examples have been classified as follows:
+ [00 &mdash; Support, Common Components, Patterns and Idioms](./00-support/)
+ [01 &mdash; Spark Core API](./01-spark-core/)


The examples have been tested on `spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7` distribution.
